          <br>Rick &amp; Morty, created by Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, is based on Justin Roiland’s take on Back to The Future, where initially Roiland wanted to create a show for the sole purpose of daring lawyers to come after him. Rick &amp; Morty was first aired in 2013, and quickly amassed a huge fan-base because of the show's dark humor and sci-fi-plots. <br>
          <br>The show focuses on the outlandish and spacy adventures of the super-crazy-mad-genius Rick Sanchez, the seam between God and man, and his dumb-timid grandson, Morty Smith. <br>
          <br>Because of the sci-fi nature of the show, the show contains many funky characters from many different universes, that is we will see everything from humans to mythological creatures to humanoids and aliens in the show.&nbsp;<br>

        <h1 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-palette-4-dark-2 u-text-1">Network Statistics</h1>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> In our analysis, we follow the five main characters ; Rick, Morty Summer Beth and Jerry. Firstly, we created a network of all the characters appearing in the show, adding links between them if they had referenced each other on their <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Rickipedia" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1" target="_blank">fandom wiki-page</a>. This resulted in our graph having 757 nodes and 532 links. <br>Each of the nodes was created with several attributes: Status (alive/dead/unknown), specie (from above), gender (male/female), original universe the character came from (e.g. C-137) and last known location of the character. The network can be seen below, where the color of the node represents the status of the character in present time:&nbsp;<br>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-palette-4-dark-2 u-text-3"> In- vs. out-degree</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-4"> If we look at the top 5 characters with respect to our graph's in-degree, we have <br>
          <br>Rick Sanchez: 90&nbsp;<br>Morty Smith: 63<br>Summer Smith: 31<br>Jerry Smith: 28<br>Beth Smith: 22<br>
          <br>If we look at the top 6 characters with respect to our graphs out-degree, we have <br>
          <br>Summer Smith: 16&nbsp;<br>Morty Smith: 15&nbsp;<br>Jerry Smith:13<br>Beth Smith: 12<br>Hemorrhage: 12<br>Morty Jr.: 12
        </p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-5"> Rick being the character with the most in-degrees (90) makes sense, since Rick is (one of) the main character in Rick &amp; Morty (The name of the show). It’s interesting how Summer has the highest out-degree - maybe it’s because she is an extremely extroverted person (in the series) and thus have a lot of references.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>However, Hemorrhage being in the top 5 out-degrees is quite funny; Rick and co. visited Hemorrhage and his universe (post-apocalyptic), rebuilding Hemorrhage's world totally until one day, where Rick became bored (and Summer broke up with Hemorrhage) and therefore tore the universe apart from the revolution the universe just experienced. Hemorrhage must have been quite mad about that, thus extending his feelings to references.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Note:</span> The in-degree being higher than the out-degree makes perfect sense, as the in-degree (and thus the linkage towards a character) is an accumulation of the wiki-pages, whereas the out-degree is from just a single page.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Analysing the in vs out degree, we do see some outliers. Most of the characters have an in-degree of below 15 whilst some characters (about 5) have higher than an in-degree of 20 (which would be our main characters, Rick, Morty, Summer, Beth and Jerry). Only two characters have an in-degree above 60 (which is Rick &amp; Morty), which makes perfect sense as Rick and Morty is a central part of Rick and Morty. Just looking at the in and out-degree distribution, we propose that these distributions take the shape of a scale-free network.
        </p>
        <h2 class="u-text u-text-palette-4-dark-2 u-text-6"> Power Law</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-7"> In the in- vs. out-distribution analysis, we proposed that our in-degree distribution was scale-free. Now, we find the exponent of the degree distribution (powerlaw package in python):<br>
          <br>-Degree exponent for in-degrees: 2.718<br>-Degree exponent for out-degrees: 3.716<br>-Degree exponent for total degrees: 2.946<br>
          <br>Here, we find that the degree exponent of the out-degree distribution is above 3, which means that this distribution is not in the scale-free region and lies towards the Random Network Regime. However, looking into the degree exponent for in-degrees as well as the degree exponent for total degrees, we see that this lies between 2 and 3, which, according to Barabasi Section 4.7, is within the scale free region, and thus our Rick and Morty network degree distribution follows a power law, which we can also see from the following plots:

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-palette-4-dark-2 u-text-8"> Comparing our network to a random network</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-9"> If we compare the degree distribution of the undirected version of our Rick &amp; Morty graph (having the same number of nodes and propability of connection), we notice a pattern: Whereas the random network’s degree distribution follows a bell-shaped curve, our Rick &amp; Morty degree distribution follows the opposite pattern. We also notice that the total degree exponent for the random network (37.39) is much higher than our own network, which then further help our case in concluding that our network is, in fact, scale free.</p>
        <h2 class="u-text u-text-palette-4-dark-2 u-text-10">Humans vs.​ Non-Humans</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-11"> If we take a look at the in- vs. out-degree of our graph with respect to humans vs. non-humans, we do find some interesting statistics: <br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-palette-5-dark-3 u-text-14"> This tells us that, in general, humans have more connections than non-humans (which, initially makes sense). The universe is around Rick and Morty’s adventures and the wiki-pages refer to a lot of humans, however we also see a lot of non-humans in there. <br>

                        <p class="u-text u-text-5"> Rick is the main character of Rick &amp; Morty. Along his path of adventures throughout the episodes, he interacts with a lot of people, as you can see in the video above. We notice that in the episode “<a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Rixty_Minutes" class="u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Rixty Minutes</a>”, Rick encounters a lot of characters. This is due to the fact that we in this episode see the first iteration of interdimensional cable throughout the seasons of Rick &amp; Morty: Cable TV capable of receiving tv from every dimension! Another thing we notice is that Mr. Goldenfold (Morty’s high school teacher) and Rick have multiple encounters throughout the seasons, 14 actually, whereas Poopybutthole and Rick have 7 encounters. One thing that might seem weird is that of all the Smith’s, Rick has the most encounters with Wong (the Smiths’ therapist), even though Rick through many episodes make it clear that therapy is for dummies, especially in the episode <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Pickle_Rick/Transcript" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">Pickle Rick</a>: <br>"Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.”&nbsp;<br>

                        <p class="u-text u-text-7"> Morty, being Rick’s faithful companion in Rick and Morty, has a similar evolving graph through episodes as Rick. This is to be expected, as Rick and Morty go on a lot of adventures together. Morty also has many encounters with Mr. Goldenfold (Morty’s high school teacher). Morty has two encounters with Wong (the Smiths’ therapist), first being in the season 3, Pickle Rick, second being in season 4, Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri. In the latter episode, while Rick and Morty are being hunted down by the Galactic federation, Rick instructs his ship to kill all of his enemies: "Smart guns, white-list human life. And the therapist.” Rick always has a funny say when it comes to therapists.</p>

(Episodes appear in chronological order.)<br>
                          <br>One thing we notice from Summer’s encounters is that at first, Summer does not have as many encounters as Rick and Morty, whilst later on throughout the seasons, Summer has more and more encounters - almost at the same level as Rick and Morty. This is due to the fact that the character of Summer has become more important (for the writers) throughout the episodes, thus Summer is getting more screen time than she got compared to when Rick and Morty just aired. <br>Quote: "Rick and Morty hit a high point when Summer was a queen in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of an early Season 3 episode, and the seventh episode in Season 4 hit a similar peak by making Summer the Supreme Empress of Glorzo”. <br>Even the fans like more of Summer, the writers realised this, and the fans got what they wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

                          <br>Beth, first seemingly being a character of less relevance of the cast proved to be a very important character. Beth has become more and more important throughout the episodes, as you can see in the video above. Beth being one of the five main characters makes her graph look quite similar to the others’, however, she got a full-on episode with (almost) only her and Rick in season 3 episode 9; The ABC’s of Beth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

                          <br>Jerry, being the worriedness and the highlight of stupidity of the Smith family, has actually had a lot of encounters throughout the episodes.

This goes to show that Jerry is not very independent and very doubtful, which we also saw in Jerry’s word cloud. Jerry only has one encounter with the Smiths’ family therapist, Wong. Jerry, having a sock puppet to be able to speak for him when going to therapy, pretty much sums it up.<br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-13"> The series is called “Rick and Morty” and not “The Smith Family”, therefore it’s not surprising to see that here the biggest word is “rick” in Morty's wordcloud. Morty often calls his grandpa directly, asking him about everything.&nbsp;<br>Moreover, the first two characters seen here are almost always together, so we can see why their names have quite high relevance in the most used words of each other.<br>Secondly, we also have the impression, that Morty is quite an insecure and doubtful character​, as most of the top words are: “oh”,”well”,”man”,”whoa”,”look”,”know”.&nbsp;<br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-14"> Summer is a unique and interesting character in the series.

                <p class="u-text u-text-16">Jerry is like a Morty to the n-th power in terms of being worried, scared and indecisive. He seems like probably the weakest and most doubtful person in all the universes.
We can clearly see that most of his words are all related to doubt and unsureness: “oh”,”well”,”mm”,”uh”,”wait”... Knowing the character, it is very likely to have all of them in the same sentence! <br>As we said earlier, Beth is like a bridge between Rick and Jerry, in fact the main character called in by Jerry is “beth”.&nbsp;<br>

                  <br>The result is quite flat. We can see below that almost all the characters have an average result close to 0, this means neutrality, but why?&nbsp;<br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-35"> With an 8.5 average IMDB-rating, one of the most high-rated animated series, it’s easy to see how Rick and Morty became a game changer in the world of cartoons. <br>But why? ​The cartoon is full of swearing and bad behaviour, bad jokes and a lot of trash talk whilst episodes usually end positively or with a character being positive. ​But what do we, the viewers, actually like the most? Trash talk or positive endings?<br>To answer the question we analyzed the sentiment of the single episodes along with it’s IMDb score and searched for any correlation.&nbsp;<br>
                </p>
                <img class="u-image u-image-default u-preserve-proportions u-image-22" src="images/normalizedratingsandsentiments.png" alt="" data-image-width="701" data-image-height="393">
                <p class="u-text u-text-36">
                  <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Here on this plot, the sentiment has been normalized on the average grade (8.5) and increased by a multiplicative factor of 4, so it aligns with the IMDB ratings and shows the relation between the two.</span>
                  <br>
                </p>
                <p class="u-text u-text-37"> We can see that the behaviour of sentiment and ratings is quite similar. We also evaluated that we have a Pearson correlation of 0.26 with a p-value of 0.3 (that means we have a 70 % of confidence that our correlation is not happening at random). This means that we have a small correlation between positive sentiment and good grades of episodes. <br>On the other hand one may argue that since the correlation is not very strong we, the audience in the C-137 universe, usually focus more on the plot, with a little bias towards good behavior episodes. As a human being of this universe I am glad that we might have enough objectivity to judge things especially with this little good-related bias. <br>
                  <br>If we display the values in a sentiment/rating plot we can see that there is a generic increasing pattern.&nbsp;<br>
